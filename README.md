# hurricane
A master-slave computer communication protocol

Hurricane is a simple to use peer-to-peer communication protocol built on top of Python 3.5. Using the pickle module, almost any kind of data can be sent between computers. Currently, Hurricane only works on a LAN configuration.

## How it works

Python's native socket library is used to create a stream to connect multiple computers and send data between.
